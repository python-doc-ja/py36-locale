msgid "Returns the number of objects in sequence *o* on success, and ``-1`` on failure.  This is equivalent to the Python expression ``len(o)``."

msgid "Return the concatenation of *o1* and *o2* on success, and *NULL* on failure. The operation is done *in-place* when *o1* supports it.  This is the equivalent of the Python expression ``o1 += o2``."

msgid "Return a tuple object with the same contents as the arbitrary sequence *o* or *NULL* on failure.  If *o* is a tuple, a new reference will be returned, otherwise a tuple will be constructed with the appropriate contents.  This is equivalent to the Python expression ``tuple(o)``."
